# PackageExample
 My attempt at automating CRUD process using commands and stubs with the initial goal to make it into a package in the future.<br>
 This project is still unfinished and a work in progress. 

 List so far of processes that are automated using a given model:
 - create a model
 - create a migration
 - create a repository
 - create a storeRequest
 - create a controller (w ready functions from stub template)
 - add route
 - add controller to route
 - add Menu link to sidebar
 - update lang labels
 - create Index view (from stub template)
 - create Create view (from stub template)
 - create Edit view (from stub template)
